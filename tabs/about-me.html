		I am currently a third year Ph.D. student at Stanford University. Broadly, my research focuses on quantum and computational chemistry. My current interests are oriented toward understanding photochemical processes of biological chromophores to optimize their performance.<br>

		<br> During my undergraduate career at Temple University, I graduated <em> summa cum laude </em> with my Chemistry B.S. in the Honors Program. While an undergraduate at Temple, I was a scholar in the <a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/MARC/Pages/USTARAwards.aspx"> Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) program </a> while working with the <a href="https://astro.temple.edu/~smatsika/Home.html"> Matsika Research Group </a>. In 2017, I was named a Graduate Research Fellow by the National Science Foundation (NSF GRFP). Currently, I am working in the <a href="http://mtzweb.stanford.edu/mtz/"> Martinez Research Group </a> at Stanford University. <br>

		<br> Aside from research, I am interested in enhancing the integration of minorities into the physical sciences. I also enjoy outdoor activities, such as ultimate frisbee, running, and basketball.
